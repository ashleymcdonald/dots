With this extension you are able to change some behaviors on any website.</p><p>All of your data are stored on your computer, I don't have any access to it.</p><md-divider></md-divider><h2 class=md-headline>What behaviors?</h2><ul><li>You can <strong>rename</strong> a tab.</li><li>You can set a new <strong>favicon</strong>.</li><li>You can <strong>pin</strong> a website without effort.</li><li>You can <strong>protect</strong> some websites from accidental closure with a confirm box.</li><li>You can avoid duplicate tabs by setting up the <strong>unique</strong> property.</li><li>You can <strong>mute</strong> the sound of any websites before they can play it (you have to enable this: <i>chrome://flags/#enable-tab-audio-muting</i>).</li></ul><p>And the icing on the cake... Combine all of them!</p><md-divider></md-divider><h2 class=md-headline>How?</h2><p>You have to create a record called a "<strong>Tab Rule</strong>".</p><p>A <strong>Tab Rule</strong> has:</p><ul><li>a <strong>name</strong>, used for you</li><li>a <strong>URL fragment</strong>, used by the extension to detect the website you want to apply actions (i.e. behaviors)</li></ul><p>After filling these info, you can now select some actions:</p><ul><li>the new <strong>title</strong> for the website, you can inject variables like <code>{title}</code> as <code>title</code> is a valid CSS selector parsed with <code>document.querySelector()</code></li><li>the new <strong>icon</strong>, select one or set a valid image URL</li><li>the <strong>pinned</strong> state (ON/OFF)</li><li>the <strong>protected</strong> state (ON/OFF)</li><li>the <strong>unique</strong> state (ON/OFF)</li><li>the <strong>muted</strong> state (ON/OFF)</li><li>the <strong>URL matcher</strong> to identify some URL parts and use them inside the title (advanced usage), enter a regular expression like <code>q=([^&]+)</code> and use <code>$1</code> in <strong>title</strong></li></ul><p>You can now go to the <a class=md-primary href="#/">Tab Rules</a> section and create your first rule...</p><p><i>Important: after creating or editing a rule, refresh the tab(s) to view the changes.</i></p><p><i>Important (2): the order of your rules is important, the first match is used and the other rules are ignored.</i></p><md-divider></md-divider><h2 class=md-headline>"URL fragment"? Meh?</h2><p>In case you don't still understand what's going on here...</p><p>The <strong>URL fragment</strong> value is the key for the extension. Let's see 2 examples.</p><h3>First example</h3><p><strong>Problem:</strong> I use GMail everyday and this tab is so important, I'm so mad when I accidentally close it and after few hours of working I can see that I have many GMail tabs opened, what a mess!</p><p><strong>Solution:</strong> I create a new Table Rule called "The GMail hell" with the URL fragment "<strong>mail.google.com</strong>". I enable "Protected" and "Unique" and I save it. Closing all GMail tabs and reopen a new one, all done!</p><p>The extension knows when to apply my actions because the GMail URL <strong>contains</strong> "mail.google.com".</p><h3>Second example</h3><p><strong>Problem:</strong> I'm usually having more than 20 tabs opened in my browser, I'm losing so much space! OK, what about pin them all? But I'm too lazy to do a right click on each tab.</p><p><strong>Solution:</strong> I create a new Table Rule called "Pin them all" with the URL fragment "<strong>http</strong>" (because almost all website URLs <strong>contain</strong> the word "http"). I enable "Pin" and I save it. Closing the browser and reopen it, all tabs are now pinned!</p><p>I hope you now understand how the <strong>URL fragment</strong> value works.</p></section></md-content>
